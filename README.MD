## Mind=Controlled 

Mind=Controlled is an alien themed accessibility-focused desktop app that lets users control their computer using only head movements, eye tracking, and voice commands â€” no hands required.
Built with MediaPipe, Vosk, and CustomTkinter, it combines real-time gaze-based cursor control with offline speech recognition, enabling actions like clicking, typing, scrolling, and navigating the desktop through natural movements and voice.
